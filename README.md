# All About LLM [@dsdanielpark](https://github.com/dsdanielpark)
 I collect and organize various resources related to large language models. Additionally, I work on documenting this information.

 I curated the comments as a sub-module to see how active the activity is while syncing forks. Therefore, this repository serves the purpose of curating comments not only for some experiments but mostly for self-checking, where I can see on my own where and when commits and pull requests frequently occur.
